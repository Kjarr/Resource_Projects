        <h2>What is Log Choke?</h2>
        <p>
          You're probably here because you have to write a <strong>bumper </strong>amount of logs and you straight up hating it right?  
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Log Choke</strong> seeks to to make it as pain-free as possible for you by reducing the need to type the same thing again and again for the "common" parts of your evidence portfolio. You simply add the meat to the text and Log Choke provides the veg and gravy for you.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong style="color: #ff4400;">Important (serious note):</strong> 
            <b>The content generated by Log Choke is not enough to create a complete log.</b>
            </br>
            Log Choke only helps you create the repetitive sections quickly. <u>You</u> still have to add content describing the machine-specific work that you carried out on site.
          </br></br>
            You will likely be questioned about some of the content in your logbook so provide plenty of detail as this will help jog your memory when asked about a specific job.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Log Choke can't be held responsible for the content of your logs. It is your responsibility to enter accurate details from memory or your own notes. Log Choke is not an official tool endorsed by an Education Authority or Card Scheme. No details are stored by Log Choke - it is a free tool, to help freely.

      <p class='paragraph1'>I arrived at the <span class='location'>"work"</span> site in the <span class='tmetme'>"dead of night"</span>. I accessed the site following the correct security and parking proceedures and made my way, using the segragated walkway, to the site office. Before starting work, I took part in a <span class='breefomeet'>"singsong"</span> which was led by our <span class='leader'>leader</span>. Special attention was given to the fact that <span class='topic'>"noona"</span> was on our site and we needed to take extra care because of it. After the meeting, I made my way out to the operational area of the site taking care to observe all safety proceedures.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Checking my machine...</strong></p>
      <p class='paragraph2'>For this job I was using a <span class='model'>leader</span> which is a <span class='machine'>"crusto"</span>. Before using the machine I carried out the checks as specified by the user manual. Amongst other checks I made sure that <span class='check1'>"brake lines were cut"</span> and also that the <span class='check2'>windows were smashed</span>. Once I was happy that the vehicle was safe to operate I started my work cycle.</p>
